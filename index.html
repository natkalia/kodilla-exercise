    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    <h2>BY EDGAR ALLAN POE</h2>

    <p>
      Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br/>
      Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br/>
      While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br/>
      As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br/>
      <span>'Tis some visitor,'</span> I muttered, <span>'tapping at my chamber door -<br/>
      Only this, and nothing more.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br/>
      And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br/>
      Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow<br/>
      From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-<br/>
      For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br/>
      Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br/>
      Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br/>
      So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br/>
      <span>'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-<br/>
      Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-<br/>
      This it is, and nothing more.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br/>
      <span>'Sir'</span>, said I, <span> 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br/>
      But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br/>
      And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br/>
      That I scarce was sure I heard you'</span>- here I opened wide the door;-<br/>
      Darkness there, and nothing more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br/>
      Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br/>
      But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br/>
      And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, <span>'Lenore!'</span><br/>
      This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, <span>'Lenore!'</span>-<br/>
      Merely this, and nothing more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br/>
      Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br/>
      <span>'Surely'</span>, said I, <span>'surely that is something at my window lattice:<br/>
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-<br/>
      Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-<br/>
      Tis the wind and nothing more.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br/>
      In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br/>
      Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br/>
      But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-<br/>
      Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-<br/>
      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br/>
      By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br/>
      <span>'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,'</span>' I said, <span>'art sure no craven,<br/>
      Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore'</span>-<br/>
      Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!<br/>
      Quoth the Raven, <span>'Nevermore.'</span><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br/>
      Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;<br/>
      For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br/>
      Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-<br/>
      Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br/>
      With such name as <span>'Nevermore.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br/>
      That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br/>
      Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-<br/>
      Till I scarcely more than muttered, <span>'other friends have flown before</span>-<br/>
      On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.<br/>
      Then the bird said, <span>'Nevermore'</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br/>
      <span>'Doubtless'</span>, said I, what it utters is its only stock and store,<br/>
      Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br/>
      Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-<br/>
      Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br/>
      Of <span>'Never- nevermore'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br/>
      Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br/>
      Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br/>
      Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-<br/>
      What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br/>
      Meant in croaking Nevermore.
    </p>

    <p>
      This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br/>
      To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br/>
      This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br/>
      On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br/>
      But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br/>
      She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    </p>

    <p>
      Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br/>
      Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br/>
      <span>'Wretch'</span>, I cried, <span>'thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee<br/>
      Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!'</span><br/>
      Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!<br/>
      Quoth the Raven, <span>'Nevermore.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>'Prophet!'</span> said I, <span>'thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or devil!-<br/>
      Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br/>
      Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-<br/>
      On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-<br/>
      Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!'</span><br/>
      Quoth the Raven, <span>'Nevermore'</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>'Prophet!'</span> said I, <span>'thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or devil!<br/>
      By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-<br/>
      Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br/>
      It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br/>
      Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.'</span><br/>
      Quoth the Raven, Nevermore.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>'Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend'</span>, I shrieked, upstarting-<br/>
      <span>'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br/>
      Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br/>
      Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!<br/>
      Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'</span><br/>
      Quoth the Raven, <span>'Nevermore'</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br/>
      On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br/>
      And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br/>
      And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br/>
      And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br/>
      Shall be lifted- nevermore!
